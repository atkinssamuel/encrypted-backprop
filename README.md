# Python Plaintext Backpropagation
This repository will serve as the first benchmark for my research on neural network training in the encrypted domain. This repository includes a benchmark neural network implementation using PyTorch as well as a manual implementation in which the backpropagation derivatives are manually computed. 

## Conda Environment Setup
**Create environment from environment.yml**:  
*From base directory:*  
```conda env create -f ./environment.yml```

**Update environment from environment.yml**:  
*From base directory and after activating existing environment:*  
```conda env update -f ./environment.yml```
